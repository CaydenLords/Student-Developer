# Greed
## Welcome to Greed
Time to mine! In this game, the robot has given up on companionship, and instead has started looking to the cold
calculating power of capitalism for happiness. Collect all the gems without getting hit by too many rocks. 
Much like real-life capitalism, the game continues until you give up on everything.
